## About Game
This is a clone of the popular sliding tile puzzle game made by Gabriele Cirulli. More information about the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)). 

This implementation is Taylor Swift themed, where instead of combining smaller numbered tiles to form the number 2048, the player combines older Taylor Swift albums with the goal of forming her latest, *Red (Taylor's Version)*. 

Made with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Gameplay

The player starts with an empty board containing two *Taylor Swift* albums. They can use the arrow keys to move the tiles around the board. When two of the same albums are combined they will form the next album. The game ends either when the player wins and *Red (Taylor's Version)* is formed, or if there is no space left to move.
